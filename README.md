# Volatility and Options Modelling with Least-Square-Monte-Carlo

This project demonstrates the use of statistical models to forecast volatility in the S&P 500 (SPY) by analyzing data over a 60 day sliding window to then price options on SPX, based on Least-Square-Monte-Carlo simulations described in Longstaff-Schwartz (2001) using a dynamic programming approach.
